## Tutorials Listing app using MERN stack - REST CRUD APIs

We will build REST APIs that create, retrieve, update, delete and find Tutorials by title.

First, we start with an Express web server. Next, we add configuration for MongoDB database, create Tutorial model with Mongoose, write the controller. 
Then we define routes for handling all CRUD operations (including custom finder).

The following table shows overview of the Rest APIs that will be exported:


| Methods | URLs | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | api/tutorials | Get all tutorials |
| GET | api/tutorials/:id | Get tutorial by `id` |
